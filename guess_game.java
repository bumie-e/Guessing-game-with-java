/* Here is why this loop is needed: As explained earlier, System.in is line bufferedâ€”you have to
press ENTER before characters are sent. Pressing ENTER causes a carriage return and a line feed
character to be generated. These characters are left pending in the input buffer. This loop
discards those characters by continuing to 
read input until neither is present.
